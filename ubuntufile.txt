Linux:
    1. Open a terminal. 
    2. Unpack the downloaded tar.gz archive. For example,
$ tar -xvzf houdini-16.5.378-linux_x86_64_gcc4.8.tar.gz
This should create a directory called houdini-16.5.378-linux_x86_64_gcc4.8/ 
    3. Run the houdini.install script:
        ◦ $ cd houdini-16.5.378-linux_x86_64_gcc4.8/ 
        ◦ $ sudo ./houdini.install
You can also double click on the houdini.install file with your mouse. It will run the installer in a terminal.
